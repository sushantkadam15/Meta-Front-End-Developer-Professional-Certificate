1. Destructuring arrays and objects:
   - Given an array of numbers, write a function to swap the first and last elements using array destructuring.
   - Write a function that takes an object representing a person with properties like name, age, and occupation. Use object destructuring to extract and print these properties.

2. For loops with objects:
   - Write a function that takes an object representing a shopping cart with items and their quantities. Use a for loop to calculate the total price of all items in the cart.
   - Given an object representing student grades with subjects as keys and scores as values, use a for loop to find the subject with the highest score.

3. For-of loops with objects:
   - Create an object that represents a playlist with songs as keys and their durations as values. Use a for-of loop to calculate the total duration of the playlist.
   - Given an object representing a dictionary with words as keys and their meanings as values, use a for-of loop to print all the words in uppercase.

4. Array and object iterations:
   - Given an array of objects representing books with properties like title, author, and year, use the `map` method to create a new array with only the titles of the books.
   - Write a function that takes an object representing a product with properties like name, price, and quantity. Use the `reduce` method to calculate the total value of the product.

5. Spread:
   - Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array combining the elements from both arrays using the spread operator.
   - Given an object representing a person with properties like name and age, create a new object with additional properties using the spread operator.

6. Rest:
   - Write a function that takes a variable number of arguments and returns their sum using the rest parameter.
   - Given an object representing a restaurant menu with dishes as keys and their prices as values, create a function that takes the menu object and prints all the dish names using the rest parameter.

7. Testing using Jest:
   - Write a test case using Jest to check if a function correctly sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
   - Create a test suite using Jest to test a calculator object that has methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
